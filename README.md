# Potatso ![GPLv3 License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-GPLv3-blue.svg)

This project is no longer being maintained. In a near future, all potatso 1 users will be migrated to Potasto 2 which is GPL free and closed-source.

A lot of people copied the project to App Store without following the license. What worse is that they've brought bad reputation to Potatso itself. 

The open source of Potatso didn't go as I thought it should be. I love open source and I will find other ways to contribute to open source community.
